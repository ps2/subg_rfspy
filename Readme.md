# subg_rfspy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ps2/subg_rfspy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ps2/subg_rfspy)

## Pre-Requisites for Building subg_rfspy

[sdcc] (http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) package is required for this build.

    sudo apt-get install sdcc

It's also possible to build it under Windows. The best way to do this is to:

1. install SDCC
2. install Cygwin
3. use Cygwin to install make
4. Use cygwin bash to build the project

# Building

You'll need to select a build type, like `spi1_alt2`.  The examples below use this value, but you'll want to use the correct one for your hardware and use case.  See below for different hardware types and use cases.

Perform the build. The output file will be stored at output/uart0_alt1_RILEYLINK_US/uart0_alt1_RILEYLINK_US.hex

    make -f Makefile.spi1_alt2

Perform the install:

    make -f Makefile.spi1_alt2 install

# Radio Frequency Selection

This code defaults to building firmware that is tuned to 916.5 Mhz. You can also build a 'WorldWide' firmware. This changes the default frequency to 868 and tweaks a few other settings.

    make -f Makefile.spi1_alt2 RADIO_LOCALE=WW

# RileyLink

If you are using a [RileyLink](https://github.com/ps2/rileylink) via the onboard bluetooth module (which should be loaded with ble_rfspy), then you'll want to use `spi1_alt2` as your build type.

# Protocol

See [protocol.md](protocol.md)


# Addendum

## Serial/Uart Support

Serial support is no longer supported.  See [serial.md](serial.md) for
historical information.

## Frequency Channel Selection

Each channel number corresponds to a different specific frequency. Channels start with 916.5 MHz at
Channel 0 and end with 934.4 MHz at Channel 255, in steps of about 0.07 MHz. You can select different
channels by adjusting the CHANNR.CHAN register. Available channels are governed by the following equation:

`f_carrier = (24MHz/(2^16))*(FREQ + CHAN(256 + CHANSPC_M)*2^(CHANSPC_E - 2))`

The base frequency, FREQ, is set by the FREQ2, FREQ1, and FREQ0 registers. The value default value is
2502768 (0x263070).  
CHANSPC_M and CHANSPC_E are used to set the channel spacing, and are contained in the registers MDMCFG0
and MDMCFG1 (bits 1:0), respectively. Their default values are 126 (0x7E) and 1.
