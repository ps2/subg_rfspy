# subg_rfspy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ps2/subg_rfspy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ps2/subg_rfspy)

## Pre-Requisites for Building subg_rfspy

[sdcc] (http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) version >= 3.7.0 is required for this build. There is a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ps2docker/sdcc_docker/) available for this purpose.

It's also possible to build it under Windows. The best way to do this is to:

1. install SDCC version 3.7.0
2. install Cygwin
3. use Cygwin to install make
4. Use cygwin bash to build the project

To install, you'll need [cc-tool](https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool)

# Building and Installing

```
make -f Makefile.spi1_alt2 install

```

# Building and Installing using docker
```
docker run -v `pwd`:/subg_rfspy  ps2docker/sdcc_docker /bin/sh -c "cd /subg_rfspy; make -f Makefile.spi1_alt2
cc-tool -n CC1110 --log install.log -ew output/spi1_alt2_RILEYLINK_US_STDLOC/spi1_alt2_RILEYLINK_US_STDLOC.hex
```

# Radio Frequency Selection

This code defaults to building firmware that is tuned to 916.5 Mhz. You can also build a 'WorldWide' firmware. This changes the default frequency to 868 and tweaks a few other settings.

    make -f Makefile.spi1_alt2 RADIO_LOCALE=WW
